# NFT MARKET PLACE

A non-fungible token is a financial security consisting of digital data stored in a blockchain, a form of distributed ledger. The ownership of an NFT is recorded in the blockchain, and can be transferred by the owner, allowing NFTs to be sold and traded.
A marketplace is a platform where vendors can come together to sell their products or services to a curated customer base. This app is a react native market place where users can create nfts and bid on nft's created by other users.
